## Getting Started
Go to root directory of app<br>
Node should be installed before running it<br>
Also install nodemon<br>
```npm i```<br>
```nodemon app.js```



## Working
<pre>
url = http://yourip:6969/
the url will give the html file but not recommended as currently data errors might be there
to add data go to url/id
id could be any number.if it exists then old data will be fetched

for esp to fetch data use url/api/id => this will return data in json format.
Caution :-  Don't try with random id.You might get error.

The project is in build so its not that efficient and might throw unexpected errors.so use according to above instructions only.
